INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 WHAT IS COFFEE? 

Coffee comes from a shrub-like tree that grows in almost any soil 

and prefers the climate between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The 

coffee tree bears flowers, ripe fruit, and unripe fruit at the same time. For 

many, coffee is first and foremost the favored source of caffeine. 

 

1.1.1 Effects of Processing Beans 

Two seeds or beans are found within the fruit of the coffee tree. The 

first step after harvesting is to remove these beans from the fruit. This is 

done in one of two ways; by dry processing or by wet processing. Wet 

processing is much more expensive although it is not true that dry processing 

always leads to an inferior product.  

1.1.1.1 Roasting coffee beans 

Roasting is the most critical and difficult stage in processing coffee. 

Every batch of beans is different and knowing how . . .

and prefers the climate between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The 

coffee tree bears flowers, ripe fruit, and unripe fruit at the same time. For 

many, coffee is first and foremost the favored source of caffeine. 

 

2.1.1 Effects of Coffee Consumption 

 

Two seeds or beans are found within the fruit of the coffee tree. The 

first step after harvesting is to remove these beans from the fruit. This is 

done in one of two ways; by dry processing or by wet processing. Wet

Thesis Proofreading Checklist for Students 

For use after all revisions and corrections requested by your department have been completed. Do not 
rely on software to do your proofreading—automated features may not work as the user intends. 

  Pagination. Check all pages in thesis, from beginning to end, one at a time to ensure that no 

pages are missing and that all pages are numbered consecutively. (Title page is page i; first page 
of main text is page 1.) All pages other than the copyright page (if included) and the title page 
should display page numbers.  

  Proofread the title page by itself for spelling errors. 

  Verify that the title and degree on the title page match the title and degree recorded on the 

Thesis/Dissertation Approval (TDA) form. 

  Proofread the Table of Contents by itself for spelling errors. 

  Check the chapter titles and section headings (if included) that are listed in the Table of 

Contents against those found in the text. For each title or heading, first check that the page 
number listed in the Table of Contents is correct. Next, check that the wording, spelling, and 
numbering of the title or heading listed in the Table of Contents exactly matches that found in 
the text. 

  Check the items contained in a List of Figures/Tables/etc. (if included) against those found in the 

text. Perform the same check as for the Table of Contents. Repeat check for each List. 

  Check the headings found in the text. Go through all chapters and chapter equivalents (e.g., 

Bibliography, Appendix, etc.) and verify that all chapter titles are formatted consistently, that all 
main-level headings are formatted consistently, and that all sub-level headings are formatted 
consistently.  

  Check figures. Turn through the pages of the thesis from beginning to end to verify that figures 
are numbered and placed consecutively and that all pages of multi-page figures have a “Figure 
x.x (cont.)” label. 

  Check tables. Perform the same check as for figures. 

  Check margins. Finally, look through the pages of the thesis one last time to make sure that no 

material in the thesis (other than page numbers) extends into any of the margins. 

For student’s use only—this form will not be turned in. Use of this form does not guarantee that no 

changes will be requested by the Graduate College Thesis Office.
